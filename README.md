Pronouns: she/they

âœ¨ I'm currently working on a deep learning model for landcover classification. I'm interested in applying the model in risk analysis and hope to expand the model with atmospheric data. 


âœ¨ I'm always open to collaborate on projects challenging commonplace systems while promoting sustainability and adaptability. My interests include climate modeling, urban environment design, and data visualization.
