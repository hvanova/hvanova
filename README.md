### Hello! Glad you're here ðŸŒ±
Pronouns: she/they

âœ¨ I'm currently working on a deep learning model for landcover classification. I'm interested in applying the model in risk analysis and hope to expand the model with atmospheric data. 

âœ¨ I'm always open to collaborate and am interested in climate variability, system simulation, and data visualization.
